# Match-3
This is a repository for the Match 3 Tutorial using Unity and C#

I am following the video series in another (private) repository and building the game from scratch. At around video 32, I decided to clone my files and start branching in another direction (also private repo at this time), while I continue with the series in my original repo. This branch from the final project files is mostly for looking at how some of the bugs I am experiencing were fixed in later videos. I don't want to cheate myself out of the learning, so I am continuing to edit code alongside the video series in my original unity project.
